                    Sick of paying extortionate amounts, just to feel like you don't have a voice? You are not alone! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an Education student, I am tired of jumping through hoops, just to get the experience I paid for! If you feel the same, read on.

                        Functional feedback
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Course feedback is requested from students with the assumption it will be listened to and acted upon, but often this is not the case. We’re pushed to give module feedback around the assessment period, ignoring the stressful and time-consuming reality of studying and often the feedback window is closed before the module is even complete! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have a right to voice our concerns and be heard. As your Education Officer I would work alongside students and academic reps to ensure that this feedback is valued and validated. After all, this is supposed to be a two-way relationship; together let's fight to ensure it is!

                        Easier extensions
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever applied for an extension, only to be met with a wall of unrealistic demands for proof? You aren’t alone! The request system now requires an extensive verification of your circumstances. However, from mental health to bereavement, some situations do not come with concrete proof, and this should never hinder your right to an extension! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As your Education Officer I would work closely with the University across all departments to achieve an easier access to extensions for all!

                        Simplifying studying
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We’ve all been there, coming to campus to find that there are no computers free and nowhere to sit! As paying students, we should be aware of the spaces and resources that the university does not yet widely publicise. Free laptop hire in the diamond, for example, frequently goes under-utilised. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Education officer, I would commit to increasing awareness of the university’s spaces and resources; fighting for better accessibility for all students, and ensuring there is always a space for you.
