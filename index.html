                    Sick of paying extortionate amounts, just to feel like you don't have a voice? You are not alone!

                <p>
                    Hey, I’m Eve, an Education student tired of jumping through hoops, just to get the experience I paid for! If you feel the same, read on.

                        Functional feedback
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        When we provide course feedback we expect that it will be listened to and acted upon, but too often this is not the case. We’re pushed to provide responses during assessments and often the form is closed before a module is even complete! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As your Education Officer I would work alongside students and reps to ensure that this feedback is valued and validated. After all, this is supposed to be a two-way relationship; let's fight to ensure it is!

                        Easier extensions
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The request system now comes with unrealistic demands for proof. However, from mental health to bereavement, some situations do not come with concrete proof.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This should never hinder your right to an extension; I would work closely with the University, across every department, to achieve easier applications for all!

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We’ve all been there, coming to campus to find that there are no computers free and nowhere to sit! As paying students, we should be aware of the spaces and resources that the university does not yet widely publicise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will commit to increasing awareness of the services we pay for; fighting for better accessibility and ensuring there is always a space for you!
